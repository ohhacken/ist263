        <p>My Opinions:</p>
        <p>
            Shark's teeth can definitely be off putting but they're still super cool.
            They're not as dangerous to humans as hollywood would have you believe.

        <p>
            I hate tarantulas. They're creepy and I don't care if they can't really hurt me. 
            They disturb me to the core of my very being and are objectively the most terrifying thing I've seen in my life.
