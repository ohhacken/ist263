        My name is Olivia Hackenberry. I am an Information Management and Technology major with a concentration in project management. I’m not fully sure what I want to do with my major yet, but my goal is to get my master's degree in library science. I’m this semester’s philanthropy chair for KTP and I can write in cursive. I like reading, watching movies/TV, hanging out with my friends, and playing with my cat.
